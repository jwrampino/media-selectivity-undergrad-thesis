## Abstract

This study utilizes a corpus of news articles to identify broad trends in media selectivity regarding coverage of Israel-Palestine. The corpus is sourced from Nexis Uni, encompassing 8,500 articles composed of 302,564 sentences from 287 major news outlets, spanning from October 6, 2023 to October 18, 2023. By leveraging BERTopic at the sentence level, the semantic and syntactic content of articles was clustered into specific hierarchical topic groups. These groups were then aggregated across source and region level to analyze selective trends in coverage. The significance of this research lies in its potential to expand data-driven media studies by studying selectivity through semantically-oriented hierarchical topic modeling as a more objective and informative lens of analyzing the media agenda. Much prior political communication research on news-media emphasized their studies as analyses of bias, sentiment, or discourse. This study analyzes selectivity in coverage, out of the conceptualization of media simultaneously as framers and gatekeepers. Focus on selectivity reorients operationalization towards objective patterns of inclusion and exclusion at multiple scales.

This project relies on the following tools and libraries:
- [BERTopic](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic) (Grootendorst, 2022) for topic modeling  
- [HDBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/) for clustering  
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) (including PCA) for preprocessing and decomposition  
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data handling  
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for visualization
- [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/) was tested for dimensionality reduction but replaced with PCA
